From this week's session two, one of the first things I have learned, which was very helpful, was the use of browser extensions from the session two readings. I had not realized that there could be so many useful extensions, such as the ad blocker one. This extension would be great for me to use personally to block any of those annoying and unwanted ads. Some other extensions include cookie management, user interface modifications, and even browser customization. Extensions are what enhance your web browser and browsing experience. 
Something else I've learned from this session was the large variety of web browsers. I personally have only used google chrome for so many years. I tried out one of the browsers, which was the Brave web browser and it seems that this browser provides many benefits compared to the other browsers. Even google chrome! Brave has many features that focus on protection and privacy. I honestly would probably stick with google chrome just because I've become much too comfortable with it over the years, but Brave will definitely be one to use maybe when traveling or even when using public wifi. I also enjoyed seeing that the Brave web browser had quite a modern and minimalist appearance to it. 
One last thingh I have learned from this session, which I had found in the activities, was clearing your cashe. I have learned that there is a way to clear your cashe within your web browser in order to minimize issues with web browsing, as well as speed up loading times. This is very useful as I occasionally do run into an seemingly endless loading wheel. Clearing my cashe in my web browser would lead to faster loading times and improved browsing performance. Plus, it could clear up storage as well within my computer.
