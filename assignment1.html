For Session 1, the first thing I have learned was from the readings in Lesson 1 where the page goes over the basics of the internet. I've learned that the internet is much more complex than just wi-fi, youtube, and social media. The lesson goes over how the internet is compiled of networks and is a "network of networks" which consists of private, public, acedemic, business, and government networks. This to me was interesting because although it is basic knowledge, it is quite remarkable to see how so many different sites, apps, media, data, etc. is compiled into these different types of networks. Ways that I could apply this to my current environment is by utilizing and exploring these different networks for looking up new information/research. 

Something else I have learned from session 1 is GitHub. I have never once heard of this type of system before. It was difficult to grasp at first with how it works and what it was exactly, but after playing around and reading about it in the lessons I have found that GitHub could be useful for many projects and not just for posting our homework assignments in this course. Perhaps, GitHub could be something for me to use in the future if I come across any projects that need to be organized and managed efficiently. 

Lastly, and one of the most useful things I've learned from session 1, is from one of the activities in lesson 1 which covers keyboard short cuts. I've learn some shortcuts that I've never really known or used before, such as "CTRL + F", to find a word on the page you are currently on. I know for a fact that this shortcut will be incredibly useful for me as it can be tough sometimes to find a specific word or passage that really highlights what you are looking for.
